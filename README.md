# E-Commerce Project

Excited to share with you my first e-commerce project built using REST APIs and React.js. This project includes a variety of features such as user authentication, browsing product catalogs, creating wish lists, adding items to a cart, and completing online payments.

## üîó Features & Tools

- Single Page Application (SPA) & Routing: Implemented using React Router to manage navigation and create a seamless user experience.
- Component Guards: Some components are protected with guards to manage user access based on authentication status.
- Authentication: User login, registration, and session management using Context and Redux.
- Form Handling & Validation: Built forms with Formik for state management and Yup for schema validation.
- Data Fetching & Manipulation: Integrated Axios for API communication to fetch, send, delete, and update data.
- Data Caching: Utilized React Query for caching displayed items, enhancing user experience with faster load times.
- React Hooks: Leveraged hooks such as `useEffect`, `useState`, `useParams`, and `useNavigate` for various functionalities throughout the application.
- Pagination: Implemented pagination using React Query to efficiently handle large data sets.
- SEO Optimization: Used `react-helmet` to dynamically generate meta titles and descriptions for each component.
- Online Payment Integration: Integrated Stripe Payment Gateway to securely handle online payments.
- UI/UX Enhancements: Styled using Bootstrap, Font Awesome, and other libraries such as Toast, AOS (Animate On Scroll), and Owl Carousel for enhanced user experience.
